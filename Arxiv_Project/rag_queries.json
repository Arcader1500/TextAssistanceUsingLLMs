    "query": "What is the Assessment Misalignment problem in Large Language Models?",
    "answer": "The Assessment Misalignment problem refers to the phenomenon where fine-tuned LLMs frequently assign higher scores (lower perplexity) to subpar Chain-of-Thought (COT) reasoning paths compared to high-quality ones, leading to potential limitations in their reasoning abilities.",

  {
    "query_id": 2,
    "query": "What are the three steps in the Alignment Fine-Tuning (AFT) paradigm?",
    "answer": "The three steps are: 1) fine-tuning LLMs with COT training data; 2) generating multiple COT responses for each question and categorizing them into positive and negative ones based on correctness; 3) calibrating the scores of positive and negative responses using a constraint alignment loss.",

  {
    "query_id": 3,
    "query": "How does the 'Constraint' objective in AFT prevent model degradation?",
    "answer": "The Constraint objective keeps the negative scores confined to a reasonable range, which prevents the model from minimizing negative scores too aggressively and degrading overall performance.",

    "query": "What are the two components of the constraint alignment loss?",
    "answer": "The two components are (a) Alignment, which ensures positive scores surpass negative scores, and (b) Constraint, which keeps negative scores within a reasonable range.",

    "query_id": 5,
    "query": "Summarize the core hypothesis behind Alignment Fine-Tuning (AFT) for reasoning.",
    "answer": "AFT hypothesizes that by aligning the model's scoring behavior—specifically ensuring it assigns higher probabilities to correct reasoning paths (positive COTs) than incorrect ones (negative COTs) while maintaining a constraint—the model's reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved beyond vanilla fine-tuning.",

    "query": "What is the main finding regarding LLMs' understanding of character composition of words?",
    "answer": "The main finding is that Large Language Models often lack a deep understanding of the character-level composition of words, meaning they struggle with tasks that require manipulating or identifying individual characters within words despite their strong token-level performance.",

  {
    "query_id": 12,
    "query": "Why do token-based LLMs struggle with character-level tasks?",
    "answer": "Token-based LLMs process text as subword tokens rather than individual characters. This abstraction causes them to overlook intrinsic character-level details, hindering their ability to perform tasks requiring fine-grained character understanding.",
