    "content": "Sumner Increase Kimball, USLSS\nA young lawyer from Maine, Sumner I. Kimball was appointed as the chief of the Treasury\nDepartment's Revenue Marine Division in 1871. He had joined the Treasury Department as a clerk\n10 years earlier and had proven his abilities as a manager. Using his hard-earned political know-\nhow, and a good dose of Yankee common sense, Kimball proceeded to completely overhaul the\nRevenue Marine and the hodge-podge system of lifesaving stations along the nation's coast that\nwere also under the control of the Revenue Marine Division. His impact on both organizations\nwould prove to be immeasurable.\nAfter the Civil War, the Revenue Marine, and the executive branch agencies generally, came under\nintense Congressional scrutiny. Economy was the name of the game during this time and",

Hence, Kimball decided to order the construction\nof new cutters not with iron hulls, which entailed considerable expense, but with proven wood\nhulls. The total number of petty officers and enlisted men was substantially cut and their pay\nreduced. Kimball also carried out a vigorous \"housecleaning\" of incompetent Revenue Marine\nofficers and saw to it that discipline was tightened. A special object of his censure was the use of\ncutters as personal yachts by local Custom officials, a wide-spread abuse during that time. Kimball\nalso put into effect a merit system to determine promotions. He also made one other great",

He also made one other great\ncontribution to the quality of the Revenue Marine by establishing, in 1877, a School of Instruction,\nto train young officers. From this move developed today's Coast Guard Academy, which still\ntrains the majority of the Coast Guard's career officers. But his greatest impact came with his work\nwith what would become the U.S. Life-Saving Service.\nSince 1848 Congress had been funding strictly volunteer stations, paying for the station and its\nequipment but relying on the local community to provide unpaid crews when needed. Kimball\ndrew up regulations that set standards for personnel performance, physical standards and station\nroutines. He convinced a parsimonious Congress to increase the funding of the Service to provide",

In\n1878, this growing network of stations was organized as a separate agency of the Treasury\nDepartment and was named the U.S. Life-Saving Service. Kimball was chosen as the General\nSuperintendent of the new service. He served in that capacity during the entire existence of the\nLife-Saving Service until it was merged with the Revenue Cutter Service in 1915 to form the new\nU.S. Coast Guard.\nRetrieved from: https://www.uscg.mil/history/people/Sumner_Kimball.asp",

Description Extinguishing agents put out fires by breaking one or more of the four elements\nof a fire tetrahedron. They work by cooling, smothering, chain breaking, or\nby a process called oxygen dilution.\nCooling reduces the temperature of a fuel source below the fuel\u2019s\n(01)\nignition point.\nSmothering separates a fuel source from its oxygen supply.\n(02)\nChain breaking disrupts the chemical process necessary to sustain a\n(03)\nfire.

With the ship at rest, the center of gravity and the center of buoyancy are always in a direct vertical line. For surface ships, center of buoyancy is usually below center of gravity, and the ship is prevented from capsizing by the additional displacement on the low side during a roll. Thus the point at which the deck edge enters the water is critical because from here onward, increased roll will not produce corresponding increased righting force. |",

Refraction also occurs when a wave passes around a point of land, jetty, or an island. |",

This instrument has been described as\none for the four pillars of the global maritime regulatory system, along with two other\nIMO Conventions, SOLAS and MARPOL, and ILO\u2019s Maritime Labour Convention. The\namendments adopted mark the first major revision of the instrument since those\nadopted in 1995, which completely revised the original 1978 STCW Convention.\nThe shipping industry depends on competent, well-trained seafarers to ensure safety",

Whether it be\ndeployment of new equipment, such as an ECDIS or the opening of new trade routes\nthrough polar waters, almost every change is bringing about either an amendment into\nan existing training module or requiring evolution of a new one.\nThe Indian maritime training sector, in close coordination with the Directorate\nGeneral of Shipping, has not just kept pace with the changes initiated at international\nlevel but has also progressively evaluated and improved training needs for its internal\nand coastal waters. The high standards achieved by Indian training fraternity are\nreflected in the stupendous growth achieved in employment of Indian seafarers\nworldwide over the past few years.",
