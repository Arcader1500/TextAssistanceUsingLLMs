This takes much practice and experience. |\n| Safety demands emphasis on preventing shock-load and reducing its effects. Shock-loading presents a definite possibility of damage to vessel fittings or tow rig failure. One of the more feared possibilities is towline snap-back.

This is\nwhere a spanner wrench helps out. Spanner wrenches are also useful if a fire\nhose is unable to be disconnected from a connection because it has been put\non too tight.\nA spanner wrench is adjustable so that is can be used with all standard sizes\nof fire hoses.

Whether it be\ndeployment of new equipment, such as an ECDIS or the opening of new trade routes\nthrough polar waters, almost every change is bringing about either an amendment into\nan existing training module or requiring evolution of a new one.\nThe Indian maritime training sector, in close coordination with the Directorate\nGeneral of Shipping, has not just kept pace with the changes initiated at international\nlevel but has also progressively evaluated and improved training needs for its internal\nand coastal waters. The high standards achieved by Indian training fraternity are\nreflected in the stupendous growth achieved in employment of Indian seafarers\nworldwide over the past few years.",
